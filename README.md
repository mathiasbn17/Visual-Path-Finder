# Visual-Path-Finder
A graphic demonstration of different path finding algorithms in pygame. 

Game module runs the program through pygame using algorithms and classes from the remaining modules. 

NOTE: Recursive division maze generation is not working. And most algorithms are not optimized with respect to time complexity.
